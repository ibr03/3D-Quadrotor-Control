# 3D Quadrotor Control

* Implemented a PD controller to control a quadrotor in 3D.

* Implemented an optimized trajectory generator to generate time parametrized trajectories such that quadrotor will navigate a given set of waypoints, namely, line and helix trajectories.

This project was part of online course 'Robotics: Aerial Robotics' offered by University of Pennsylvania through coursera.org.
